Potential release candidate, only small issues remain:

- 240p sound through component adapter is crackling again, will fix in RC1
- 240p video is stable but in order to work properly, 480p needs to be selected first and then switched into 240p
- 480p audio seems to only work with "alt audio" toggled on but needs confirmation
- Small scaler misalignments might be present. Please report any game window misalignments.
- 1080i scaler options need adjusting, may not work as is

To be tested in beta 5:
- Audio compatibility and "alt audio" mode (32KHz sample frequency, 48KHz when off)
- Tv/Monitor compatibility
- Any visual glitches (i.e. Majora's mask intro or OOT save load screen)
- Filters, check for any issues through out the scaler options
