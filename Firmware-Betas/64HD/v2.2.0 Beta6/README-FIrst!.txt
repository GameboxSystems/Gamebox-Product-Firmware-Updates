If you get a black screen after flashing, adjust the "filter brightness" setting. The new firmware is reading your brightness level as 0.

Known issues so far:
-Adjust audio for higher gain to make output louder
-adjust 960p timings for stability
-revert 640x480 back to 720x480 due to issues across the devices
-adjust scalers as indicated from feedback - some modes need to be shifted to remove "rainbow lines"
